                <p class="text-justify">An employment website is a web site that deals specifically with employment or
                    careers. Many employment websites are designed to allow employers to post job requirements for a
                    position to be filled and are commonly known as job boards. Other employment sites offer employer
                    reviews, career and job-search advice, and describe different job descriptions or employers. Through
                    a job website a prospective employee can locate and fill out a job application.</p>
